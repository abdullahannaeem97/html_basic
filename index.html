		<p>
			<b>What a wonderful way to end your day at the beach! Florida's sunsets are spectacular, particularly from the</br> vantage point of any Gulf Coast beach. There are two beach communities that think every sunset is reason</br> enough to celebrate, Clearwater Beach and Key West. Those communities put on a nightly party that includes</br> live entertainment, street performers, and craft vendors.</b>
